1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I ask you to listen to what I am about to say, because I will try to explain why we get high electricity prices in Norway.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The first principle everyone must understand is that the electricity always goes where the price is highest.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That is the main principle.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The second principle is that all the 17 cables that go out of Norway, in theory, can export half of the electricity we use in Norway in a year.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Only the last two cables to Germany and the United States doubled the export capacity from Southern Norway.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But this will never happen, I will not guarantee that, that we will export half of our electricity.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
In fact, we do not need to export a single drop of water power for the electricity price in Norway to be as high as in Germany.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Not a single drop of water power. And here, follow me now, here comes the explanation.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I take it in four parts.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Part one is that everyone who produces power and everyone who buys power or wants to buy power, they meet at a marketplace.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It can, for example, be called Nordpol.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And there are Germans, there are Swedes, Danes, Norwegians, many people.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Part two is that the water power producers, this is the main principle, they sell of course to those who pay the most.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And if they are Germans, then a lot of electricity goes to Germany.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Part three is that the Norwegian electricity companies, and we know these, we know them.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
They are called Fjordkraft, Norges Energi, Tibber and so on.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes, they have made agreements with us, Norwegian consumers, that they will give us electricity every day.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And then most of us have spot price agreements.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What that really means is that we have given electricity companies the right to buy electricity from us for an unlimited price.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So when Norwegian water power plants know that they can get a higher price abroad than in Norway,

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and they know that we have large cables that allow them to export a lot,

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
then they put the price on their water power high, because they know that the Norwegian electricity companies,

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
they want this electricity not like that, and they are willing to pay what it costs to beat Germans and Brits.

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And part four here is that we consumers, we must accept this price as this system is.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But if the price is very high, then we start saving.

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So, power producers do their job, they just have to pay as much for the water as possible.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Electricity companies also do their job.

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
They should just get us electricity, no matter what it costs.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And we consumers do our job as well.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We buy power, we buy the electricity we need, and we start saving if it becomes too expensive.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:07,000
All of this can happen without any power physically going from Norway to abroad.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Was that too much, Eivrik?
