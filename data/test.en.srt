1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I would like you to listen to what I have to say now, because I will try to explain why we get high current prices in Norway.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The first principle everyone must understand is that the current always goes where the price is highest.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That is the main principle.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The second thing we must understand is that all the 17 cables that go out of Norway can, in theory, export half a part of the electricity we use in Norway in the course of a year.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And only the two last cables to Germany and Serbia, double the export capacity from Sørenøge.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But this will never happen, I will not guarantee.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This will not happen that we export half a part of our electricity.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
In fact, we do not need to export a single drop of water power, because the current price in Norway will not be as high as in Germany.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Not a single drop of water power.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And here, I feel now, here comes the explanation.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll take it in four, Trin.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Trin 1 is that everyone who produces power, and everyone who buys power, or wants to buy power, meets at a market place.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It can, for example, be called a Nordpol.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And there it is German, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, but many people.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Trin 2 is that the power producers, this is the main principle, they sell of course to those who pay the most.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And if that is German, then a part of the current goes to Germany.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Trin 3 is that the Norwegian power companies, and we know them, we know them.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
They are called Fjordkraft, Norge Seneggi, Tibber, and so on.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes, they have agreed with us, Norway, to use, that they will give us electricity, die around.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And then they have most of our spot price numbers.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What that actually means, is that we have given the power companies permission to buy electricity for us for an unlimited price.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So when Norwegian power companies know that they can get a higher price abroad than in Norway,

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and they know that we have big cables that make them export a lot,

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
then they put the price on their water power high, because they know that the Norwegian power companies,

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
they want to have this power as it is, and they want to pay what it costs, to make Germany and Britain.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And Trin 4 here, is that we have to use, we have to accept this price as this system is,

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
but if the price is very high, then we begin to save.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So, the power companies do their job, they just have to pay as much for the water as possible.

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The electricity companies also do their job.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
They are actually just going to give us the electricity, no matter what the price is.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And we use it, we still do our job.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We buy power, we buy the electricity we need, and we begin to save if it gets too expensive.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:07,000
All this can happen, except that it basically goes from Norway to the abroad.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes, it's too many now.
